 This document provides a step-by-step plan to implement car movement in a vehicular combat game using WASD and arrow keys for control. Each step introduces a specific feature, allowing you to implement and test it independently before moving to the next. This approach ensures that the car's movement is built progressively and any issues can be caught early.

Step 1: Display the Car
Implementation
Create a car object with an initial position (x, y) (e.g., center of the screen) and a direction theta (e.g., 0 radians, facing right).
Render the car on the screen at (x, y), rotated by theta to match its direction.
Play-Testing
Confirm that the car appears on the screen at the specified position and orientation.
Step 2: Move the Car Forward
Implementation
Assign a constant speed v (e.g., 5 units per second).
Update the car's position every frame based on its speed and direction:
dx = v * cos(theta) * delta_time
dy = v * sin(theta) * delta_time
x += dx
y += dy
delta_time is the time elapsed since the last frame (in seconds).
Play-Testing
The car should move in a straight line in the direction it’s facing (e.g., to the right if theta = 0).
Step 3: Steering
Implementation
Add input detection for steering:
If A or Left Arrow is pressed, decrease theta by steering_speed * delta_time.
If D or Right Arrow is pressed, increase theta by steering_speed * delta_time.
Use a steering_speed like 90 degrees per second (or 1.57 radians per second).
Play-Testing
While the car is moving, pressing A or Left Arrow should turn it left, and D or Right Arrow should turn it right, visibly changing its path.
Step 4: Variable Speed with Acceleration
Implementation
Define variables: acceleration (e.g., 5 units per second²) and max_speed (e.g., 10 units per second).
If W or Up Arrow is pressed:
Increase v by acceleration * delta_time.
Cap v at max_speed (if v > max_speed, set v = max_speed).
If W or Up Arrow is not pressed, keep v constant.
Play-Testing
Pressing W or Up Arrow should make the car accelerate up to max_speed.
Releasing the key should maintain the car’s current speed.
Step 5: Friction
Implementation
Add a friction value (e.g., 2 units per second²).
When neither W/Up Arrow nor S/Down Arrow is pressed:
If v > 0, decrease v by friction * delta_time, but not below 0.
If v < 0, increase v by friction * delta_time, but not above 0.
Play-Testing
After accelerating with W or Up Arrow and releasing the key, the car should gradually slow down and stop due to friction.
Step 6: Braking and Reversing
Implementation
Define braking (e.g., 8 units per second²) and min_speed (e.g., -5 units per second, a negative value for reverse).
If S or Down Arrow is pressed:
If v > 0 (moving forward), decrease v by braking * delta_time, but not below 0.
If v <= 0 (stopped or moving backward), decrease v by acceleration * delta_time, but not below min_speed.
Ensure friction (from Step 5) applies only when no movement keys (W, Up, S, Down) are pressed.
Play-Testing
While moving forward, pressing S or Down Arrow should slow the car faster than friction alone, stopping at v = 0.
When stopped, pressing S or Down Arrow should make the car move backward.
While moving backward, pressing S or Down Arrow should increase reverse speed up to min_speed.
Step 7: Fine-Tuning
Implementation
Adjust the following parameters to optimize the car’s handling:
acceleration: Rate of speed increase.
braking: Rate of speed decrease when braking.
friction: Rate of natural slowdown.
steering_speed: Rate of turning.
max_speed: Maximum forward speed.
min_speed: Maximum reverse speed.
Experiment with values to achieve smooth, responsive, and fun controls.
Play-Testing
The car should feel intuitive to drive, with balanced acceleration, braking, turning, and stopping behavior.
Notes
Coordinate System: Assumes a 2D top-down view where theta determines the car’s heading, and position updates use trigonometry.
Rendering: Ensure the car’s sprite rotation matches theta each frame for visual consistency.
Delta Time: Use delta_time in all calculations to ensure movement is frame-rate independent.
This plan builds the car’s movement from a static display to a fully controllable vehicle, with each step adding a testable layer of functionality. By following this sequence, you can verify the car behaves as expected at every stage before adding complexity.
