# VibeCars - Development Progress

## Completed Features

### Initial Setup (April 1, 2025)
- Created the basic HTML structure with Three.js and Cannon.js imports
- Implemented a responsive canvas with fullscreen support
- Added basic UI elements for score and controls display

### Game Engine (April 1, 2025)
- Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
- Implemented Cannon.js physics world with proper gravity and collision detection
- Created a box-shaped arena with walls and holes in the floor
- Added lighting system (ambient and directional lights with shadows)

### Vehicle Implementation (April 1, 2025)
- Designed a simple car model with chassis and wheels
- Implemented physics-based car movement using WASD/arrow keys
- Added car details (windshield, colored body, wheels)
- Implemented car dynamics with proper weight, damping and friction

### Game Mechanics (April 1, 2025)
- Added projectile shooting mechanism (space bar)
- Implemented horn sound (Q key)
- Created bunny hop/flip mechanism (E key)
- Implemented collision detection between car, projectiles, and environment
- Added reset mechanism when car falls through holes

### Camera System (April 1, 2025)
- Implemented a third-person camera that follows the car
- Added smooth camera transitions with lerp interpolation
- Created proper camera positioning relative to car orientation

### Audio System (April 1, 2025)
- Initially tried using external sound files (faced CORS issues)
- Refactored to use Web Audio API for procedurally generated sound effects
- Implemented custom sound effects for shooting, honking, and hopping

### Miscellaneous (April 1, 2025)
- Added proper error handling for audio playback
- Implemented responsive design for window resizing
- Created a simple Node.js server for local development
- Initialized git repository and committed changes

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Physics sometimes behaves unexpectedly on certain browsers
- PowerShell execution policy can block the Node.js server execution
- Car can occasionally get stuck on walls or in corners

## Future Development Plans

### Short-term Goals
- Add multiple cars for multiplayer functionality
- Implement enemy AI cars
- Add scoring system based on projectile hits
- Create more complex arena with ramps and obstacles

### Medium-term Goals
- Add power-ups and special abilities
- Implement different car models with unique characteristics
- Create a level progression system
- Add particle effects for collisions and explosions

### Long-term Goals
- Implement networked multiplayer
- Add gamepad/controller support
- Create a car customization system
- Implement a more sophisticated physics model for car damage
